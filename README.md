A general Recursion Problem in haskell

Problem Question
Two friends are sitting at bottom of a flight of 10 steps and debating in how many ways can they
jump up the stairs. They can jump one, two or three steps at a time. For example they can cover
the 10 steps by jumping (3, 3, 3, 1) or (2, 3, 3, 2) or other suitable combinations. Their mathematics
is not very strong and they approach you for help. Implement a Haskell function that provides
a general solution (not only for 10 but for general n steps). The function should report only the
number of solutions and not the solutions themselves. No induction proof is required.
